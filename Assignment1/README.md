## A Little About Assignment 1

It wasn't easy, but after much tweaking of the emulator's memory settings and lots of time waiting for it to come up and constantly show messages about the UI not responding, I managed to get the emulator to show the app. Note that I typed in `npm run android` in the terminal. This got me an IP address an port that I was also able to type into Expo Go on my phone. So, maybe that's an approach but it still took awhile and I think I needed the emulator running for the server to register a connection so I could then use the phone. I may have to just see if my other computer can be set up to do dev work for this class. 6 Gig RAM is not enough. Anyhoo, here's a pretty picture.
